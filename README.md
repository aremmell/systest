# systest

This is just a small CLI utility I wrote for the purpose of testing code that needed to work on multiple platforms, and to probe platforms/systems for their capabilities.

You may find it useful if you are also writing cross-platform code, and do not want to go through the work of testing your entire app/library on each platform–this lil guy can do it for you.

It is primitive though; it’s currently using a shell script for compliation. Maybe if I need it again later on, I’ll implement CMake.
